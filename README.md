# pairAnimal

There is an application that helps people find the perfect partners for their pets. It works like a social network where users can create profiles for their pets, providing basic information such as name, breed, age, personality, and interests.

Users can browse through the profiles of other pets and decide whether they like them or not. If two users like each other, they can start communicating through an in-app chat.

Such an application can be useful for those who are looking for a companion for their pet. It helps to find animals with similar interests and personalities, which can increase the chances of a successful introduction and friendship.

Moreover, the application can be an interesting pastime for those who simply love animals. Users can browse through photos and descriptions of different breeds of animals and enjoy interacting with other animal enthusiasts.

Thus, this application helps people find pets that match their preferences and interests and can be a fun pastime for those who love animals and want to enjoy their beauty and uniqueness.

Xib
Firebase

NotificationCenter
Realm
